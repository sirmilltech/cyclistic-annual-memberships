Casual riders tend to take longer trips, particularly on weekends and during leisure hours, suggesting recreational use. In contrast, annual members use bikes more consistently during weekdays and commuting hours, indicating practical, frequent use.\n\n###   Given these insights, converting casual users into members is achievable by highlighting convenience, savings, and flexibility. Casual riders could benefit from unlimited rides and cost-effective pricing, especially if they increase usage frequency. Marketing strategies should focus on showing the value of a membership for weekend excursions, seasonal outings, and potential for daily commuting. Special promotions during peak casual use months (summer, weekends) could drive conversions. In-app notifications, loyalty rewards, and highlighting convenience (e.g., station availability, time saved) would reinforce this transition.\n\n###  Visualizations strongly support the case for targeted marketing â€” casual riders represent a pool of potential members who could save money and gain value through annual plans.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"---\n## ðŸ“Š Data Sources\n- Historical trip data with usertype (Customer/Subscriber)\n- New trip format with member_casual (casual/member)\n- Combined, cleaned, and analyzed over 500,000 rides\n\n---\n\n## ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights\n\n### âœ… Rides by Day of the Week\n- **Members** ride more during weekdays â€” likely commuting.\n- **Casual riders** peak on **weekends** â€” for leisure.\n\n---\n\n### âœ… Trip Duration\n- Casual riders have **longer trips** (avg. duration higher).\n- Members use rides more frequently but for **shorter trips**.\n\n---\n\n### âœ… Monthly Trends\n- Casual usage **peaks in summer** (Juneâ€“August).\n- Members show more consistent usage year-round.\n\n---\n## ðŸ’¡ Recommendations\n### Digital Media Strategies:\n- ðŸŽ¯ **Targeted weekend promotions** for casual riders\n- ðŸ“± **Social media ads** showing membership value\n- ðŸ“§ **Email follow-ups** after casual rides with join prompts\n- ðŸ“… **Seasonal ad boosts** in warmer months\n---","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Thanks\n---\nMr Austine O.
